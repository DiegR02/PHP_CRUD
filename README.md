# PHP_CRUD
Simple E-Shop developed in PHP. Includes CRUD.

If you want to host this website locally, you can use XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

Once installed, you have to initialize XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL module.

If you installed XAMPP with default settings, you must clone this project in C:\xampp\htdocs.

Finally, you have to write on your browser localhost/PHP_CRUD. If you have changed the name of the project, you should write localhost/"new name of the project"
