# PHP_CRUD
Simple E-Shop developed in PHP. Includes CRUD.

If you want to host this website locally, you can use XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

Once installed, you have to initialize XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL module.

If you installed XAMPP with default settings, you must find in your File Browser the route C:\xampp\htdocs, and clone there the project.

Finally, you have to write on your browser; localhost/PHP_CRUD. If you have changed the name of the project, you should write; localhost/"new name of the project".
