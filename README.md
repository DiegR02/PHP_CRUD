# PHP_CRUD üóÑÔ∏è
Simple E-Shop developed in PHP. Includes CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

## How to deploy 

If you want to host this website locally, you can do it for free installing [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html).

Once installed, you have to initialize XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL modules.

If you installed XAMPP with default settings, you must find in your File Browser the path **C:\xampp\htdocs**. Then, you can clone there the project.

Finally, to get started you need to write on your browser **localhost/PHP_CRUD**. If you have changed the name of the project, your path should look like this: **localhost/{new name of the project}**.
